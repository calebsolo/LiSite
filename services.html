		<h3>Individual, Family, and Couples Counseling</h3>
 		<p>I offer counseling for a variety of concerns including relational issues, depression, anxiety, life transition, grief, and trauma. Child focused interventions encourage parenting support and education as a means of helping kids achieve their goals. Clients are encouraged to set realistic, measurable and incremental goals and we evaluate progress throughout treatment. I will coordinate care with collateral supports (for example teachers or physicians providing prescription medication) when a client decides it is in his or her best interest and with his or her written consent. </p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <div class="col-sm-4">
		<h3>Counsultation</h3>
 		<p>Interested in evolving your social service business or non-profit programs?  I welcome the opportunity to help you and your staff assess your needs in order to offer effective, innovative, and practical solutions.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <div class="col-sm-4">
		<h3>Clinical Supervision</h3>
 		<p>Off-site supervision of Licensed Master Social Workers (LMSW) is  a valuable and rewarding part of the profession. I provide this service to a limited number of qualified individuals for a reasonable fee. </p>
	 </div>
	  
	  <div class="col-lg-10">
		<h3>Insurance</h3>
		<p>The relationship between a client and therapist is built on a foundation of privacy and confidentiality. With very few exceptions, information about clients may not be shared without a client's written consent. The following exceptions to confidentiality are based on legal statutes and ethical standards:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Suspected child abuse, abuse of a dependent adult, or elder abuse</li>
			<li>If a client is threatening serious bodily harm to another person(s)</li>
			<li>If a client is threatening serious bodily harm to himself or herself</li>
		</ul>
	 </div>
	  
	  <div class="col-lg-10">
		<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
		<p>The cost to clients is $100 for each 50 minute session. Acceptable forms of payment include cash, personal checks, and most credit cards. I also accept Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana.</p>
		<p>Other insurance carriers may provide out-of-network benefits and reimburse you for some or all of your therapy costs when you use an out-of-network provider; I am happy to assist with this process. </p>
